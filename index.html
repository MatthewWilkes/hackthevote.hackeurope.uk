                Hack the vote
              </h1><br>


              <p>
                <a href="http://www.ukpolitical.info/Turnout15.htm">Under 25&apos;s have the
                lowest registration rate and turnout of any demographic</a>. The recent move to
                individual electoral registration has been highlighted by both the 
                <a href="http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/163144/Confirmation-Dry-run-2013-Results-report.pdf">Electoral Commission</a>
                and the <a href="http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/voter-registration">Electoral Reform
                Society</a> as likely to disproportionately disenfranchise young people and
                students.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a little over three months the European referendum will take place, a vote
                that will hugely affect this generation&apos;s future. As a national vote, the turnout
                of students and young people will be all the more important. Unlike at a General
                Election, in a referendum,without geographic distribution, every vote counts.
              </p>

              <p>
                In June 2016 this generation will have a chance to have its say. Yet, if you are
                an 18 year old who has never voted, doesn&apos;t respond to letters or, even have a
                landline phone, you are far less likely to realise this. <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~dnickers/files/papers/Nickerson.JOPM2006.pdf">
                Research tells us</a> that normal contact methods consistently fail to reach you. Young
                people aren&apos;t failing to vote because they don&apos;t care. They&apos;re failing to vote
                even though they care; because we don&apos;t reach them and show them how. </p>
              <p>
                We want to change this, and need your help to make it happen at an event on the
                <em>23rd and 24th of April in London.</em> Let's use our skills to hack the problem
                together.
              </p>

              <p>
                HackEurope is an informal group who love data, coding and civic engagement, and
                that think the best way we can contribute to this vital vote is to apply our
                skills. We&apos;ve teamed up with London First to organise a hack weekend in London
                with the theme of engaging 18-25 year olds in registering and turning out to vote.

              <li>Please sign up as a multi-disciplinary team that you intend to work with. If you
              don&apos;t have a team with all the skills you need then please get in touch and we can
              introduce you to others in the same situation.</li>
              
              <li>If you can think of an idea ahead of the weekend about what you want to make
              then please do. If not, that&apos;s fine, we have a few ideas of our own that you can
              pick from. Communication is key here, please let us know what skills your team has
              and the kind of thing you want to build and we can talk beforehand. We want
              everyone to be able to hit the ground running.</li>
                
              <li>If your situation changes and you can&apos;t make it, please let us know well in advance.</li>
              
              <li>If you&apos;re coming from outside London please make arrangements to sleep. Nobody
              wants to be in a room full of people that have worked flat out for 2 days without
              sleep or showers.</li>
              
              <li>We have an <a href="coc.html">anti-harassment policy</a> that we take very
              seriously. Please read it and make sure you agree to it.</li>

              <li>You do not need experience in politics or campaigning to come and work on
              this. We have arranged for advisors with the relevant experience to be present.
              </li>
              
              <li>You own everything you create. All we ask is that you use an open source
              licence of your choice and make sure the code is distributed at the end of the
              event. We aren&apos;t a company looking to harvest ideas or get work for free, we just
              want to make sure that no work is wasted if people decide not to continue
              volunteering after the hackathon.</li>
              
              <li>Electoral law is serious business. We ask that you heed our advice if we tell
              you that one of your ideas wouldn&apos;t be permissible.</li>
