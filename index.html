              lowest registration rate and turnout of any demographic</a>. The recent move to
            individual electoral registration has been highlighted by both the

            In a little over three months the European referendum will take place, a vote
            that will hugely affect this generation&apos;s future. As a national vote, the turnout
            of students and young people will be all the more important. Unlike at a General
            Election, in a referendum,without geographic distribution, every vote counts.

            In June 2016 this generation will have a chance to have its say. Yet, if you are
            an 18 year old who has never voted, doesn&apos;t respond to letters or, even have a
            landline phone, you are far less likely to realise this. <a href="http://www3.nd.edu/~dnickers/files/papers/Nickerson.JOPM2006.pdf">
            Research tells us</a> that normal contact methods consistently fail to reach you. Young
            people aren&apos;t failing to vote because they don&apos;t care. They&apos;re failing to vote
            even though they care; because we don&apos;t reach them and show them how.
