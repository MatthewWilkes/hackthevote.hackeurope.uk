                <p>HackEurope is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We do not
                    tolerate harassment or bullying of any community member in any form. This does not only extend to
                    members of HackEurope, but to anyone who chooses to become involved in the larger
                    community of event attendees and volunteers through events or interactions.</p>

                <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal/electronic comments related to personal characteristics or
                    choices, sexual images or comments in public or online spaces, deliberate intimidation, bullying,
                    stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of presentations,
                    Slack chats, electronic meetings, physical meetings or other events, inappropriate physical
                    contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or bullying
                    behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

                <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, representatives of the community may take
                    reasonable action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, expulsion from any
                    HackEurope event, or expulsion from mailing lists, Slack communities, discussion boards and other electronic
                    communications channels to resolve the issue.</p>

                <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
                    concerns, please act to intercede or ask for help from an administrator of HackEurope community,
                    Slack admins or organizers/representatives of any physical events put on under the auspices of
                    HackEurope.</p>
